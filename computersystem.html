        <h1> INFORMATION PROCESSING CYCLE/COMPUTER SYSTEM </h1>
<ul>
<h2> The information processing cycle, also known as the data processing cycle or simply the computer cycle, is a series of steps that a computer follows to process data and produce useful information. This cycle is fundamental to the operation of computer systems and is repeated continuously as the computer performs tasks. The basic steps in the information processing cycle are as follows: </h2>
</ul> 
<ul>
    <h2>  Input: This is the first stage of the cycle, where raw data is entered into the computer system. Input devices, such as keyboards, mice, scanners, and sensors, are used to capture data and send it to the computer for processing.</h2>
</ul>
<ul>
<h2>Processing: Once the data is input, the computer's central processing unit (CPU) performs operations on the data. This involves manipulating, calculating, and organizing the data according to the instructions provided by software programs. The processing stage is where the actual computation and decision-making occur.  </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
<h2> Storage: After processing, the computer stores the results in its memory. This can be temporary storage in RAM (Random Access Memory) or more permanent storage on a hard drive or other storage devices. Data needs to be stored so that it can be retrieved and used later. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Output: The processed data is then presented to the user in a human-readable form. Output devices, such as monitors, printers, and speakers, display or print the results of the processing. This stage allows users to understand the information generated by the computer. </h2>
</ul>
