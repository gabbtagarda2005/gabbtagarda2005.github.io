            <h1> HTML AND CSS </h1>
<ul>
    <h2> HTML is a markup language used to structure content on the web. It consists of a series of elements (tags) that define the different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> HTML provides the basic structure of a web page, organizing content into a meaningful and hierarchical format. It forms the backbone of a webpage and is responsible for structuring the text, images, and other elements. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It allows developers to control the appearance of HTML elements by defining styles like colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and more. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> CSS is used to enhance the presentation of a web page, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. It separates the structure (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), allowing for greater flexibility and easier maintenance. </h2>
</ul>
