        <h1> CONCEPT OF COMPUTER SECURITY </h1>
        <ul>
            <h2>   Computer security, cyber security, digital security or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from attacks by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware, software, or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. </h2>
        </ul> 
<ul>
    <h2> Computer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, is a broad field that encompasses measures and practices designed to protect computer systems, networks, data, and information from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or theft. The goal of computer security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital information. Here are key concepts related to computer security: </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Confidentiality: This principle involves protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can access certain data or resources. Encryption, access controls, and user authentication are common methods to maintain confidentiality. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2>  Integrity: Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered during storage, processing, or transmission. Measures such as checksums, digital signatures, and access controls help verify the integrity of data and protect against unauthorized modifications.</h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Availability: Availability ensures that computer systems and resources are accessible and operational when needed. This involves preventing and mitigating disruptions caused by events such as hardware failures, software errors, or malicious attacks. Redundancy, backup systems, and disaster recovery plans contribute to availability. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Authentication: Authentication verifies the identity of users, devices, or systems attempting to access resources. Passwords, biometrics, two-factor authentication, and digital certificates are common methods used to establish the authenticity of entities in a computer system. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Authorization: Authorization determines the level of access or permissions granted to authenticated users. Access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC), define what actions users or systems are allowed to perform within a given environment. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Firewalls: Firewalls are security devices or software that monitor and control network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (such as the internet), helping to prevent unauthorized access and attacks. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): IDPS are tools that monitor network or system activities for suspicious behavior or security policy violations. They can detect and respond to potential security incidents in real-time. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Encryption: Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure format using algorithms and keys. This helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access during storage, transmission, or processing. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Security Policies and Procedures: Establishing and enforcing security policies and procedures are essential for maintaining a secure computing environment. This includes defining acceptable use policies, incident response plans, and guidelines for data handling. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Security Audits and Monitoring: Regular security audits and monitoring activities help identify vulnerabilities, assess compliance with security policies, and detect unusual or malicious activities. This proactive approach allows organizations to address security issues before they lead to breaches. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Patch Management: Keeping software, operating systems, and applications up-to-date with the latest security patches is crucial for addressing known vulnerabilities. Patch management helps close potential entry points for attackers. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2> Social Engineering Awareness: Social engineering involves manipulating individuals to divulge confidential information. Security awareness training helps users recognize and resist social engineering tactics, such as phishing attacks. </h2>
</ul>
<ul>
<h2> These concepts collectively contribute to a comprehensive approach to computer security, helping organizations and individuals safeguard their digital assets in an increasingly interconnected and digital world.</h2>
</ul>
